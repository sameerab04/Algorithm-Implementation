# CS 1501: Algorithm Implementation 
|Assignment| Overview|
|----------|---------|
| p1| Create a recursive, backtracking solution to filling in the squares of a crossword puzzle and find all possible solutions to a given crossword puzzle board|
|p2| Create a dynamic representation of a trie that monitors the number of children at each level and utilizes either a DLB and array-based implementation of nodes in order to store and traverse a dictionary of words.|
|p3| The purpose of this assignment is for you to fully understand the LZW compressionalgorithm, its performance and its implementation.|
|p4| The purpose of this programming assignment is to implement a  digital signature system using the RSA cryptosystem.|
|p5| The purpose of this assignment is to give you practice implementing some simple graph algorithms and to see how they can be used in a somewhat practical way.|
